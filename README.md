# About the Game

X-Wing vs Tie Fighters will be a 2D collision avoidance game. The game will start with a start button clicked. The X-Wing will move through a field of passing by Tie Fighters. If the X-Wing hits a Tie the game will be over. A message will be displayed telling the user they have "Fell to the evil Hands of the Empire" and a resart button will allow them to restart. The player will start from the begining everytime they die. If the X-Wing successfully navigates the Tie Fighters for long enough they win, but will have the option to continue to see how long they can survive.
